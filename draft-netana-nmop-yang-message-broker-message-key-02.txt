            YANG Message Keys for Message Broker Integration
          draft-netana-nmop-yang-message-broker-message-key-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism to define a unique message key
   for a YANG to message broker integration and a topic addressing
   scheme based on YANG-Push subscription type and a YANG index defined
   in this document.  This enables YANG data consumption of a subset of
   subscribed YANG data, either per specific YANG node, identifier or
   telemetry message type, by indexing and organizing in Message Broker
   topics, indexing the information by using data taxonomy and organize
   data in partitions and shards.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays network operators are using machine and human readable YANG
   [RFC7950] to model their configurations and monitor YANG operational
   data from their networks according to [Mar24].

   Most network analytic use cases require real-time data and the
   delivery of near real-time analytical and actionable insights.  This
   imposes high scalability, resilience and low overhead in the data

   processing pipeline.  Accessing the right data for the right use case
   with minimal overhead and in the shortest period of time is therefore
   crucial.

   Network operators organize their data in a Data Mesh [Deh22]
   according to [Bod24] where a Message Broker, such as Apache Kafka
   [Kaf11] or Apache Pulsar [Pul16], facilitates the exchange of
   messages among data processing components in topics and subjects.
   Typically, data is being stored in Message Broker topics for several
   hours or days to facilitate resilience in the data processing chain
   and addressed in subjects depending on schema, enabling a data
   consumer to address and re-consume previously consumed data again if
   previously lost.

   Dimensional data is structured information in a data store.  It uses
   a model of dimension tables to organize business metrics and their
   descriptive context.  This model, developed by Ralph Kimball [Kim96],
   simplifies data analysis and reporting by creating denormalized,
   easy-to-understand structures for quick querying.  It is optimized
   for online analytical processing (OLAP) and data warehouses by using
   the data taxonomy to scale in partitions and shards.  YANG [RFC7950]
   as a data modelling language facilitates the modelling of dimensional
   data.

   An Architecture for YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] specifies an
   architecture for integrating YANG-Push with Message Brokers for a
   Data Mesh architecture.  Section 4.5 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] describes how the
   notification messages at a YANG-Push Receiver are being transformed
   to the Message Broker while Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] specifies to a
   message schema to contextualize telemetry data.  However, neither of
   these documents address how these messages should be indexed in a
   message broker, nor define how topics, partitioning and sharding must
   be used.

   Due to this missing dimensional indexing for Message Broker stored
   YANG data, all YANG data is stored in one single Topic.  This leads
   to a round robin distribution across multiple Partitions where each
   YANG schema id is defined as a subject within that topic.  Therefore,
   the entire Topic from all Partitions needs to be consumed first
   before data selection can be applied.  This leads to avoidable data
   processing overhead which in turn impairs scalability and real-time
   capabilities, required for certain Network Analytics use cases.

   YANG telemetry data can be used for several network analytic use
   cases.  Importantly, depending on the use case, only a subset of the
   subscribed YANG data might be necessary (in time or space).  For
   example, for specific use cases, it is more important to know the
   current network state, as opposed to have the full series of the
   state changes over time.  In other use cases, instead of consuming
   data for all network nodes, only a specific network node or network
   node component requires the YANG monitoring and hence subscription.

   This document defines how YANG messages
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] should be indexed
   and organized in Message Broker topics by leveraging the network node
   hostname, the YANG datastore name and a YANG Item Identifier for
   indexing.  Then, a YANG-Push subscription type and YANG schema name
   for a Message Broker topic naming scheme is defined to better
   organize YANG data.

   Network node hostname, YANG datastore name and subtree and xpath
   filters are part of "ietf-yang-push-telemetry-message" structured
   YANG data defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message].  YANG item
   identifier are derived from subtree and xpath filters respectively
   from their YANG schema tree.

   *  Message Broker

   *  YANG Message Broker Producer

   *  YANG Message Broker Consumer

   The following terms are used as defined in Apache Kafka [Kaf11] and
   Apache Pulsar [Pul16] Message Broker:

   *  Subject: Is used for Messages within a Topic sharing the same
      schema tree and also to identify a unique schema tree within a

      the term Log Compaction with identical meaning.

   *  Partition: Messages in a topic are spread over hash buckets where
      a hash bucket refers to a partition being stored on one message
      broker node.  Message ordering is guaranteed within a partition.

   *  Shard: The same as Partition but distributed among message broker
      nodes.  In this document, the term Partition is being used
      primarily but concept equally applies also to Shards.

   *  Message: A piece of structured data sent between data processing
      components to facilitate communication in a distributed system

   *  Message Key: Metadata associated with a message to facilitate
      deterministic hash bucketing.

      globally unique.  When the schema node identifier points to a YANG
      list, then the key to that list is included.  The YANG Index is
      used to generate the Message Key.  See Section 3.1.1 .

3.  Solution Design

   To identify which network node produced which YANG data into which
   Message Broker Topic, Partition and Subject, YANG Message Keys and
   Indexes (Section 3.1.1) are being introduced.  These keys enable a
   deterministic distribution of YANG messages accross Topics and
   Partitions enabling applications to consume only the needed data from
   specific topics and partitions.

   In order to facilitate Message Broker Topic Compaction, a YANG-Push
   subscription type based topic naming scheme (Section 3.2) is defined.
   This segregates statistical (Value), State and State change YANG
   metrics and facilitates a YANG Message Broker Consumer to use the
   Topic wild card consumption method to select based on YANG-Push
   subscription type.

3.1.  YANG Message Keys and Indexes

   A Message Broker uses a Message Key to index the message and a value
   to carry the Message content.  If no Message Key is defined then the
   Messages are distributed in a round robin fashion across partitions.
   If a Message Key is defined, then the value of the Message Key is
   being used as input for the Message Broker Producer hash function to
   distribute across Partitions.  Therefore, Message Keys facilitate
   Message deterministic distribution.

   The Message Key not only used for Message indexing at the Message
   Producer but also at the Message Broker for topic compaction.

   For YANG, the network node hostname, from which YANG datastore the
   YANG metrics are published from and the YANG index is used to
   generate the Message Key.

   The following sections describe how Message Keys are used in both
   message producers and message consumers.

3.1.1.  YANG Message Broker Producer

   YANG data nodes are uniquely identifiable within the YANG schema
   tree.  Section 6.5 of [RFC7950] defines with "absolute-schema-nodeid"
   how absolute YANG schema node identifiers are being crafted locally
   unique to the YANG module.

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9254] defines how globally unique YANG Item
   Identifiers are defined as text strings.

Internet-Draft              YANG Message Keys              December 2025


   Section 3.6 of [RFC8641] defines how YANG data nodes can be
   subscribed with subtree and xpath selection filters.  A YANG-Push
   publisher publishes with "subscription-started" state notifications
   for each subscription which filter and filter type is being used to
   the YANG-Push receiver.

   To derive the YANG Indexes and generate the Message Key, the YANG
   item identifier needs to be extracted from the used YANG-Push subtree
   or xpath subscription filter.  If the YANG item identifier is a YANG
   list as defined in Section 7.8 of [RFC7950] the YANG list key defined
   in Section 7.8.2 of [RFC7950] statement is suffixed with a "/" to the
   YANG Item Identifier.

   For example, if the following xpath filter is being used, the YANG
   Item Identifier is "ietf-interface:interfaces/interface".  Interface
   is a YANG list with name as key.  Therefore, the YANG Index of the
   Message Key is "ietf-interface:interfaces/interface/name".

   ietf-interface:interfaces/interface[type='ianaift:ethernetCsmacd']

          Figure 1: YANG-Push ietf-interface Xpath Filter Example

   For example, if the following subtree filter is being used, the YANG
   Item Identifier is "ietf-hardware:hardware/component/state".
   Therefore, the YANG Index of the Message Key is "ietf-
   hardware:hardware/component/state".

   <get>
     <filter type="subtree">
       <hardware xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-hardware">
         <component>
           <state/>
         </component>
       </hardware>
     </filter>
   </get>

          Figure 2: YANG-Push ietf-hardware Subtree Filter Example

   When the Message is being produced to the Message Broker, the Network
   node hostname and YANG datastore name is used from the structured
   YANG data defined in "ietf-yang-push-telemetry-message" Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] where the YANG Index
   is derived from subtree and xpath filters, respectively from their
   YANG schema tree.

3.1.2.  YANG Message Broker Consumer

   The consumer hashes the Message Key and applies modulo with the
   number of partitions to determine the partition it needs to consume
   from to obtain Messages with desired Message Key.

   At a YANG data store, such as a Time Series database or stream
   processor, the YANG data could than be ingested into tables according
   to topic names and indexed per Message Key.  If Topic Compaction is
   enabled, only current state is consumed.

3.1.3.  Time Series Database

   Text

3.2.  YANG-Push Message Broker Topic Naming

   YANG data can be subscribed periodically, 'on-change' or 'on-change'
   with 'sync-on-start'.  Periodical subscriptions are used for
   obtaining statistical metrics.  On-Change subscriptions are used for
   obtaining State Changes and on-change with sync-on-start is used for
   obtaining States.

   Message Brokers topics are addressed with a unique name.  Usually
   topics are named hierarchically similar to the DNS namespace where
   "." deliminates hierarchies.

   This document defines "statistics", "states" and "state-changes" in
   the topic name as the first part to denote the types of data.
   Followed by "yang" to denote YANG data.  Followed by the YANG module
   names subscribed, and followed by the YANG Schema Node Identifier
   where "/" is substituted by "_".

   For example, if the "ietf-interface:interfaces/interface" xpath
   filter is being used, the Message Broker topic name would be as
   following.  In the example the project name and environment (prod,
   dev, test etc.) is prefixed.

   project.environment.statistics.yang.ietf-interfaces.interfaces_interface

Internet-Draft              YANG Message Keys              December 2025


3.2.1.  YANG Message Broker Producer

   For the Message Broker topic creation, the "periodic", "on-change"
   and "sync-on-start" contained data in "update-trigger" from "ietf-
   subscribed-notifications", YANG module defined in Section 4.1 of
   [RFC8641], subscription state notifications MUST be used to derive
   wherever subscribed YANG data is "statistics", "states" or "state-
   changes".  The YANG Index MUST be derived from subtree and xpath
   filter data of subscription state notifications, respectively from
   their YANG schema tree.

3.2.2.  YANG Message Broker Consumer

   The consumer has the ability to consume with a wildcard denoted with
   "*" in the topic name to consume from more than one topic.

   For example, if YANG states should be consumed and indexed in Time
   Series database or stream processor than below Topic Name could be
   used, and the YANG data could be ingested into tables according to
   topic names and indexed per Message Key.  If Topic Compaction is
   enabled, only current state is consumed.

   project.environment.states.yang.*

              Figure 4: YANG-Push Wildcard Topic Name Example

4.  Message Broker Implementations

   Topic, Partitioning and Message Keys are generic concepts of Message
   Brokers.  There are two known Message Broker implementations
   supporting all features described in this document.

4.1.  Apache Kafka

   Apache Kafka supports Message Keys, Partitioning and Log Compaction.

   With "min.cleanable.dirty.ratio" and "min.compaction.lag.ms" how
   often and when Log Compaction should occur is being configured.

   The topic names are constrained to 249 character length and the
   following characters: "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9", ".", "_" and "-".  Topics
   can be created on the fly by producing into a new Topic when
   "auto.create.topics.enable" has been configured prior.  Topics should
   be deleted at the end of the lifecycle through the kafka-topics.sh
   command.

Internet-Draft              YANG Message Keys              December 2025


   The Partition count for a given Topic can be increased but not
   decreased.  Consumer groups are automatically re-joined and
   partitions are being rebalanced on Message Broker nodes when
   Partition count changed.

4.2.  Apache Pulsar

   Apache Pulsar supports Message Keys, Partitioning and Topic
   Compaction.

   With "brokerServiceCompactionThreshold" when Topic Compaction should
   occur is being configured.

   The topic names allow all characters except: "/".  Topics can be
   created on the fly by producing into a new Topic when
   "allowAutoTopicCreation" has been configured prior.  Topics should be
   deleted at the end of the lifecycle through pulsar-admin or pulsarctl
   tools.

   The Partition count for a given Topic can be increased but not
   decreased.  Consumer groups are automatically re-joined and
   partitions are being rebalanced on Message Broker nodes when
   Partition count changed.

5.  Time Series Database Implementations

   Tables, partition and keys are generic concepts of time series
   databases.  With ClickHouse, this document examples how YANG Message
   Keys can be obtained from Message Broker and how it can used for
   indexing.

5.1.  ClickHouse

5.1.1.  Data Model

   Unlike other realtime analytics databases, ClickHouse does not
   (necessarily) rely on partitioning data by timestamp.  ClickHouse
   represents data in the MergeTree format, which is similar to a LSM
   tree:

   A table consists of data parts sorted by primary key.

   When data is inserted in a table, separate data parts are created and
   each of them is lexicographically sorted by primary key.  For
   example, if the primary key is (MessageKey, Date), the data in the
   part is sorted by MessageKey, and within each MessageKey, it is
   ordered by Date.

Internet-Draft              YANG Message Keys              December 2025


   Data belonging to different partitions are separated into different
   parts.  In the background, ClickHouse merges data parts for more
   efficient storage.  Parts belonging to different partitions are not
   merged.  The merge mechanism does not guarantee that all rows with
   the same primary key will be in the same data part.

   Each data part is logically divided into granules.  A granule is the
   smallest indivisible data set that ClickHouse reads when selecting
   data.  ClickHouse does not split rows or values, so each granule
   always contains an integer number of rows.  The first row of a
   granule is marked with the value of the primary key for the row.  For
   each data part, ClickHouse creates an index file that stores the
   marks.  For each column, whether it's in the primary key or not,
   ClickHouse also stores the same marks.  These marks let you find data
   directly in column files.

   Thus, it is possible to quickly run queries on one or many ranges of
   the primary key.

5.1.2.  Message Broker Integration

   ClickHouse integrates with Message Brokers through Integration
   Table Engines.

   Here is a Data Definition Language example:

   CREATE TABLE queue (
      timestamp UInt64,
      level String,
      message String
   ) ENGINE = Kafka('localhost:9092', 'topic', 'group1', 'JSONEachRow');

   Reading (selecting) data through Kafka Table Engine follows Kafka
   semantics of advancing the offset, so subsequent reads will start at
   the offset the previous read left off.

   It is the responsibility of the data model designer to transfer data
   to a regular table:

   *  Use the engine to create a Kafka consumer and consider it a data
      stream.

   *  Create a table with the desired structure.

   *  Create a materialized view that converts data from the engine and
      puts it into a previously created table.

   The message key and partition ID are available as virtual (read only)
   columns _key and _partition.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   This document should not affect the security of the Internet.

8.  Operational Considerations

   The YANG Message Broker Producer of a YANG-Push receiver should have
   three config knobs facilitate the features described in this document
   as optional:

   *  Topic Distribution: Select between "topic" and "subject"
      distribution.  Default is subject to remain backward compatibility
      to [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration].

   *  Distribution Type: Select between "none" and "YANG-Push
      subscription type".

   *  YANG Message Key: Select between "enable" and "disable".

   Subject distribution enables message ordering for a set of YANG
   Message Keys on each partition.  Where in topic distribution messages
   are randomly being distributed among partitions.

   To accommodate for potential date loss throughout the data processing
   pipeline, periodical update of the current State for State metrics is
   RECOMMENDED.  This can be accommodated with YANG-Push as defined in
   [RFC8641] by complementing "on-change sync on start" subscriptions
   with periodical subscriptions.  Alternatively, in YANG-Push Lite
   defined in Section 7.6 of [I-D.wilton-netconf-yang-push-lite] this
   simplified in one subscription.

Acknowledgements

   Thanks to Camilo Cardona, Rob Wilton, Holger Keller, Reshad Rahman
   and Nigel Davis for their comments and reviews.

   We also like to thank Victor Lopez for the initial idea on the
   network controller use case.  Ashley Woods, Sivakumar Sundaravadivel
   and Rafael Julio for the idea of grouping topics by YANG-Push
   subscription type and insisting that Topic Compaction is a key
   enabler for inventory metrics and YANG data consumer integration and
   should be supported day 1.  And Nigel Davis for confirming that Topic
   Compaction simplifies indeed data processing system architecture.

Contributors

   Many thanks goes to Hellmar Becker who contributed Section 3.1.3 and
   Section 5 on how YANG Message Keys can be obtained from Message
   Broker, how time series databases can use it for indexing YANG data
   and example implementation in ClickHouse.
