            YANG Message Keys for Message Broker Integration
          draft-netana-nmop-yang-message-broker-message-key-01

Abstract

   This document specifies a mechanism to define a unique message key
   for a YANG to message broker integration and a topic addressing
   scheme based on YANG-Push subscription type and a YANG index defined
   in this document.  This enables YANG data consumption of a specific
   YANG node identifier from a network node datastore on a single
   Message Broker topic and partition; and Message Brokers to compress
   topics to the current state for YANG state metrics.

1.  Introduction

   Nowadays network operators are using machine and human readable YANG
   [RFC7950] to model their configurations and monitor YANG operational
   data from their networks according to [Mar24].

   Most network analytic use cases require real-time data and deliver
   near real-time analytical, actionable insights.  This imposes high
   scalability, resilience and low overhead in the data processing
   pipeline.  Accessing the right data for the right use case with
   minimal overhead and in the shortest period of time is therefore
   crucial.

   Network operators organize their data in a Data Mesh [Deh22]
   according to [Bod24] where a Message Broker such as Apache Kafka
   [Kaf11] or Apache Pulsar [Pul16] facilitates the exchange of messages
   among data processing components in topics and subjects.  Typically,

Internet-Draft              YANG Message Keys               October 2025


   data is being stored in Message Broker topics for several hours or
   days to facilitate resilience in the data processing chain and
   addressed in subjects depending on schema, enabling a data consumer
   to address and re-consume previously consumed data again if
   previously lost.

   Dimensional data is structured information in a data store.  It uses
   a model of dimension tables to organize business metrics and their
   descriptive context.  This model, developed by Ralph Kimball [Kim96],
   simplifies data analysis and reporting by creating denormalized,
   easy-to-understand structures for quick querying.  It is optimized
   for online analytical processing (OLAP) and data warehouses.  YANG
   [RFC7950] as a data modelling language facilitates the modelling of
   dimensional data.

   An Architecture for YANG-Push to Message Broker Integration
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] specifies an
   architecture for integrating YANG-Push with Message Brokers for a
   Data Mesh architecture.  How the notification messages at a YANG-Push
   Receiver are being transformed to the Message Broker is described in
   Section 4.5 of [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration] and to
   which message schema in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message], however how
   messages should be indexed best for dimensional YANG data is left
   unspecified.

   Due to the missing dimensional indexing for Message Broker stored
   YANG data, all YANG data is stored in one single Topic, distributed
   round robin across multiple Partitions and each YANG schema id is a
   subject within that topic.  Therefore, the entire Topic from all
   Partitions needs to be consumed first before data selection can be
   applied.  This leads to avoidable data processing overhead which in
   turn impairs scalability and real-time capabilities, required for
   certain Network Analytics use cases.

   YANG telmetry data can be used for several network analytic use
   cases.  Importantly, depending on the use case, only a subset of the
   subscribed YANG data might be necessary (in time or space).  For
   example, for specific use cases, it's more important to know the
   current network state, as opposed to have the full series of the
   state changes over time.  In other use cases, instead of consuming
   data for all network nodes, only a specific network node or network
   node component requires the YANG monitoring and hence subscription.

Internet-Draft              YANG Message Keys               October 2025


   This document defines how YANG messages
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] should be indexed
   and organized in Message Broker topics by leveraging the network node
   hostname, YANG datastore name and YANG Item Identifier for indexing;
   and YANG-Push subscription type and YANG schema name for a Message
   Broker topic naming scheme.

   Network node hostname, YANG datastore name and subtree and xpath
   filters are part of "ietf-yang-push-telemetry-message" structured
   YANG data defined in Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message].  YANG item
   identifier are derived from subtree and xpath filters respectively
   from their YANG schema tree.

   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   *  Subject: A named communication channel where a schema id is
      associated.

   *  Topic: A communication channel for publishing and subscribing
      messages with one or more subjects.

   *  Topic Compaction: The act of compressing messages in a topic to
      the latest state.  As used with Apache Pulsar.  Apache Kafka uses
      the term Log Compaction with identical meaning.

   *  Partition: Messages in a topic are spread over hash buckets where
      a hash bucket refers to a partition.

   *  Message: A piece of structured data sent between data processing
      components to facilitate communication in a distributed system

   *  Message Key: Metadata associated with a message to facilitate
      deterministic hash bucketing.

   The following terms are used as defined in Confluent Schema Registry
   Documentation [ConDoc18]:

   *  Schema: A formalized, documented structure that defines the shape
      and content of the messages exchange.

   *  Datastore

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC7950]:

   *  Schema Node Identifier

   *  Schema Tree

   The following terms are used as defined in [RFC9254]:

   *  YANG Item Identifiers

   This document defines the following term:

   *  YANG Index: Is a subset of YANG Item Identifiers containing only
      schema node identifiers.  Different to an absolute schema node
      identifier it includes the YANG module name and is therefore
      globally unique.  When the schema node identifier points to a YANG
      list, then the key to that list is included.

3.  Solution Design

   In order to identify which YANG node identifier of a network node
   YANG datastore is produced in which Message Broker Topic and
   Partition for which Subject, YANG Message Keys and Indexes
   (Section 3.1) are being introduced.

   In order to facilitate Message Broker Topic Compaction, a YANG-Push
   subscription type based topic naming scheme (Section 3.2) is
   proposed.  This segregates statistical (Value), State and State
   change YANG metrics and facilitates a YANG Message Broker Consumer to
   use the Topic wild card consumption method to select based on YANG-
   Push subscription type.

3.1.  YANG Message Keys and Indexes

   A Message Broker MUST use a Message Key to index the message and a
   value to carry the Message content.  If no Message Key is defined
   then the Messages are distributed in a round robin fashion across
   partitions.  If a Message Key is defined, then the value of the
   Message Key is being used as input for the Message Broker Producer
   hash function to distribute across Partitions.  Therefore, Message
   Keys facilitate Message ordering.

   The Message Key not only used for Message indexing at the Message
   Producer but also at the Message Broker for topic compaction.

   For YANG, the network node hostname, from which YANG datastore the
   YANG metrics are published from and the YANG index is used to
   generate the Message Key.

3.1.1.  YANG Message Broker Producer

   YANG data nodes are uniquely identifiable within the YANG schema
   tree.  Section 6.5 of [RFC7950] defines with "absolute-schema-nodeid"
   how absolute YANG schema node identifiers are being crafted locally
   unique to the YANG module.

   Section 3.3 of [RFC9254] defines how globally unique YANG Item
   Identifiers are defined as text strings.

   Section 3.6 of [RFC8641] defines how YANG data nodes can be
   subscribed with subtree and xpath selection filters.  A YANG-Push
   publisher publishes with "subscription-started" state notifications
   for each subscription which filter and filter type is being used to
   the YANG-Push receiver.

   To calculate the YANG Index of the Message Key, the YANG item
   identifier needs to be extracted from the used YANG-Push subtree or
   xpath subscription filter.  If the YANG item identifier is a YANG
   list as defined in Section 7.8 of [RFC7950] the YANG list key defined
   in Section 7.8.2 of [RFC7950] statement is suffixed with a "/" to the
   YANG Item Identifier.

   For example, if the following xpath filter is being used, the YANG
   Item Identifier is "ietf-interface:interfaces/interface".  Interface
   is a YANG list with name as key.  Therefore, the YANG Index of the
   Message Key is "ietf-interface:interfaces/interface/name".

   ietf-interface:interfaces/interface[type='ianaift:ethernetCsmacd']

          Figure 1: YANG-Push ietf-interface Xpath Filter Example

   For example, if the following subtree filter is being used, the YANG
   Item Identifier is "ietf-hardware:hardware/component/state".
   Therefore, the YANG Index of the Message Key is "ietf-
   hardware:hardware/component/state".

       </hardware>
     </filter>
   </get>

          Figure 2: YANG-Push ietf-hardware Subtree Filter Example

   When the Message is being produced to the Message Broker, the Network
   node hostname and YANG datastore name is used from the structured
   YANG data defined in "ietf-yang-push-telemetry-message" Section 3 of
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-message-broker-telemetry-message] where the YANG Index
   is derived from subtree and xpath filters, respectively from their
   YANG schema tree.

3.1.2.  YANG Message Broker Consumer

   The consumer hashes the Message Key and applies modulo with the
   number of partitions to determine the partition it needs to consume
   from to obtain Messages with desired Message Key.

3.2.  YANG-Push Message Broker Topic Naming

   YANG can be subscribed periodically, on-change or on-change with
   sync-on-start.  Periodical subscriptions are used for obtaining
   statistical metrics.  On-Change subscriptions are used for obtaining
   State Changes and on-change with sync-on-start for obtaining States.

   Message Brokers topics are addressed with a unique name.  Usually
   topics are named hierarchically similar to the DNS namespace where
   "." deliminates hierarchies.

   This document proposes to include "statistics", "states" and "state-
   changes" in the topic name as the first part to denote the types of
   data.  Followed by "yang" to denote YANG data.  Followed by the YANG
   module names subscribed, and followed by the YANG Schema Node
   Identifier where "/" is substituted by "_".

   For example, if the "ietf-interface:interfaces/interface" xpath
   filter is being used, the Message Broker topic name would be as
   following.  In the example the project name and environment (prod,
   dev, test etc.) is prefixed.

   project.environment.statistics.yang.ietf-interfaces.interfaces_interface

           Figure 3: YANG-Push ietf-interface Topic Name Example

3.2.1.  YANG Message Broker Producer

   For the Message Broker topic creation, the "periodic", "on-change"
   and "sync-on-start" contained data in "update-trigger" from "ietf-
   subscribed-notifications", YANG module defined in Section 4.1 of
   [RFC8641], subscription state notifications are being used to derive
   wherever subscribed YANG data is "statistics", "states" or "state-
   changes".  The YANG Index is derived from subtree and xpath filter
   data of subscription state notifications, respectively from their
   YANG schema tree.

3.2.2.  YANG Message Broker Consumer

   The consumer has the ability to consume with a wildcard denoted with
   "*" in the topic name to consume from more than one topic.

   For example, if YANG states should be consumed and indexed in Time
   Series database or stream processor than below Topic Name could be
   used, and the YANG data could be ingested into tables according to
   topic names and indexed per Message Key.  If Topic Compaction is
   enabled, only current state is consumed.

   project.environment.states.yang.*

              Figure 4: YANG-Push Wildcard Topic Name Example

4.  Message Broker Implementations

   Topic, Partitioning and Message Keying are generic concepts of
   Message Brokers.  There are two known Message Broker implementations
   supporting all features described in this document.

4.1.  Apache Kafka

   Apache Kafka supports Message Keying, Partitioning and Log
   Compaction.  The topic names are constrained to 249 character length
   and the following characters: "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9", ".", "_" and "-".

4.2.  Apache Pulsar

   Apache Pulsar supports Message Keying, Partitioning and Topic
   Compaction.  The topic names allow all characters except: "/".

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document includes no request to IANA.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document should not affect the security of the Internet.

7.  Operational Considerations

   The YANG Message Broker Producer of a YANG-Push receiver SHOULD have
   three config knobs facilitate the features described in this document
   as optional:

   *  Topic Distribution: Select between "topic" and "subject"
      distribution.  Default is subject to remain backward compatibility
      to [I-D.ietf-nmop-yang-message-broker-integration].

   *  Distribution Type: Select between "none" and "YANG-Push
      subscription type".

   *  YANG Message Key: Select between "enable" and "disable".

   To accommodate for potential date loss throughout the data processing
   pipeline, periodical update of the current State for State metrics is
   RECOMMENDED.  This can be accommodated with YANG-Push as defined in
   [RFC8641] by complementing "on-change sync on start" subscriptions
   with periodical subscriptions.  Alternatively, in YANG-Push Lite
   defined in Section 7.6 of [I-D.wilton-netconf-yang-push-lite] this
   simplified in one subscription.

Contributors

   We like to thank Victor Lopez for the initial idea on the network
   controller use case.  Ashley Woods, Sivakumar Sundaravadivel and
   Rafael Julio for the idea of grouping topics by YANG-Push
   subscription type and insisting that Topic Compaction is a key
   enabler for inventory metrics and YANG data consumer integration and
   should be supported day 1.  And Nigel Davis for confirming that Topic
   Compaction simplifies indeed data processing system architecture.
